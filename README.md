# MCP server for Obsidian

MCP server providing tools to interact with Obsidian via the Local REST API community plugin.

> **Note**: This is a maintained fork of [MarkusPfundstein/mcp-obsidian](https://github.com/MarkusPfundstein/mcp-obsidian).

## Installation

### 1. Install the Obsidian Plugin

Install and enable the [Local REST API](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) community plugin in Obsidian. Copy the API key from the plugin settings.

### 2. Add to Your MCP Client

Add this server to your MCP client configuration. Examples for common clients:

**Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-obsidian-ek"],
      "env": {
        "OBSIDIAN_API_KEY": "<your_api_key_here>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code** (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-obsidian-ek"],
      "env": {
        "OBSIDIAN_API_KEY": "<your_api_key_here>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Tip**: If `uvx` isn't found, use `which uvx` to get the full path and use that instead.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OBSIDIAN_API_KEY` | Yes | — | API key from Local REST API plugin |
| `OBSIDIAN_HOST` | No | `127.0.0.1` | Obsidian host address |
| `OBSIDIAN_PORT` | No | `27124` | Obsidian REST API port |

## Requirements

| Obsidian Plugin | Required | Notes |
|-----------------|----------|-------|
| [Local REST API](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) | Yes | v3.0+ recommended |

| `obsidian_get_active` | Get the currently open note |
| `obsidian_get_periodic_note` | Get daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly note |
| `obsidian_get_recent_periodic_notes` | Get recent periodic notes |

### Commands & UI
| Tool | Description |

## Example Prompts

**File operations:**
- "Get the contents of my last meeting note and summarize it"
- "Search for all files mentioning 'project deadlines'"
- "Create a new note called 'summary.md' with this content"

**Active note & periodic notes:**
- "What note do I have open? Summarize it"
- "Show me this week's weekly note"
- "What did I write in my daily notes last week?"

**Commands & UI:**
- "Open my project notes in a new tab"
- "Show me all available Obsidian commands"

## Advanced Features

### Path Encoding

Handles filenames with spaces, special characters, Unicode, and emojis:

```
Projects/2024 Q1/meeting notes.md
Área/configuração/São Paulo.md
Research (2024)/data #1 & analysis.md
Projects/documentation/notes.md
```

### Template-Aware Heading Insertion

When using `obsidian_patch_content` to insert content under a heading that doesn't exist, the heading is auto-created in the correct position based on your template structure.

**How it works:**
1. Checks the note's frontmatter for a `template:` field
2. Falls back to folder convention: `Daily Notes/*.md` uses `Templates/Daily Notes.md`
3. Inserts new headings in template order (not appended to end)

**Example:** If your template has `## Todos`, `## Notes`, `## Journal` and your note only has Todos and Journal, patching to "Notes" inserts it between them.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `create_heading_if_missing` | `true` | Auto-create missing headings |
| `template_path` | auto | Explicit template path |
| `use_template` | `true` | Use template for positioning |
