### Bug Fixes

- Remove build_command from semantic-release config
  ([`ec40b32`](https://github.com/ernestkoe/mcp-obsidian/commit/ec40b32eb0bcaaca46ad48ce042122401e8feab1))

The semantic-release action runs in its own container without uv. Since we're not publishing to
  PyPI, we don't need to build.
